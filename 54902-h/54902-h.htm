<p>“<i>These elementary beings, we are told, were by their constitution more
long-lived than man, but with this essential disadvantage, that at death
they wholly ceased to exist. In the meantime they were inspired with an
earnest desire for immortality; and there was one way left for them, by
which this desire might be gratified. If they were so happy as to awaken
in any of the initiated (Rosicrucians) a passion, the end of which was
marriage, then the sylph became immortal.</i>”&mdash;Godwin’s “Lives of the

<span class="i0">There was a princess once, who loved the slave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of an Assyrian king, her father; known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Nineveh as Hadria; o’er whose grave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sands of centuries have long been blown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sooner shall the night forget its stars<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than love her story:&mdash;How, unto his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day she came, where, with his warriors,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The King sat in his hall of audience,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Mid pillared trophies of barbaric wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, kneeling to him, asked, “O father, whence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes love and why?”&mdash;He, smiling on her said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“O Hadria, love is of the gods, and hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divine, is only soul-interpreted.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But why love is, ah, child, we do not know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless ’t is love that gives us life when dead.”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And then his daughter, with a face aglow<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_477" id="page_477"></a>{477}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the love that clamored in her blood<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its sweet avowal, lifted arms of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like Aurora’s rose, before him stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Saying,&mdash;“Since love is of the powers above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love a slave, O Asshur!&mdash;Let the good<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gods have giv’n be sanctioned.&mdash;Speak not of<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonor and our line’s ancestral dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>They</i> are imperial dust. <i>I</i> live and love.”&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black as black storm then rose the King and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lightning gesture sweeping at her there,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="iq">“Enough! ho, Rhana, strike me off her head!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And at the mandate, with his limbs half bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slave strode forth. Majestic was his form<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As some young god’s. He, gathering up her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wound it three times around his sinewy arm;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then drew his sword. It for one moment shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A semicircling light, and, dripping warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lifting the head he stood before the throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said the despot, “By the horn of Bel!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This was no child of mine!”&mdash;Like chiseled stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stern stood the slave, a son of Israel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_478" id="page_478"></a>{478}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then striding towards the monarch, in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wrath of heaven and the hate of hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shrieked, “Beast! I loved her! look on us and die!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swifter than fire clove him to the brain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then kissed her face, and, holding it on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out, “Judge thou, O God, between us twain!”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, fifty daggers in his heart, fell slain.<br /></span>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
